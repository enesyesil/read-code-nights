# read-code-nights
A collaborative knowledge repo created by a group of SWE friends. Every week we meet at night to code, read, and learn together.

## What This Repo Is
This is our **living notebook**, a place where our SWE friend group:
- Reads and summarizes **papers, articles, and concepts**
- Solves **LeetCode problems**
- Shares **notes, discussions, and insights**
- Keeps track of our progress week after week

Think of it as a log of our **collective growth journey**.
